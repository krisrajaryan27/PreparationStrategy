SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol  REST : Representational State Transfer
1. Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) - to provide API for converting Object to XML and XML to Object easily.
		JAXB Marshalling: Converting a Java Object to XML.
		JAXB Unmarhsalling: Converting XML to Java Object.

JAXB - uses java annotations. - Why ?
- Beacuse we need to annotate Java Object to provide instructions for XML Creation and then we have to create Marshaller to convert Object to XML.

JAXBContext - Entry point for JAXB and provides methods to get marshaller and unmarshaller objects.

Basic and Useful Annotations are :
1. @XMLRootElement- mandatory annotation for the object to be used in JAXB. Defines the root element for the XML Content.
2. @XMLType- Maps the class to the XML Schema Type.Used for ordering the elements in the XML.
3. @XMLTransient- This makes sure that the Object property is not written to the XML.
4. @XMLAttribute- Creates Object property as attribute.
5. @XMLElement(name="abc")- Creates the element with name "abc".

WebServices-1. SOAP 2. REST 
Two specifications in Java world for WebServices- 1. JAX-WS(SOAP) 2. JAX-RS(REST)
What is webservice- A service made available over the network/web.Website is meant for Human consumption while the Webservice is meant for code/application level consumption.It allows two different machines/applications/codes to interact with earch other.Interoperablility
